Dev C++ is an IDE, it comes with MingW's port of GCC compiler. Great Compiler by the way and its ***free***.

You will notice they have a Pascal IDE too, with the Free pascal compiler.

But yeah... Visual Studio another IDE that comes with Microsoft's compiler is a nice choice too for its very user friendly interface.(IMO the best IDE for windows os)
Express edition: (free edition)

I find it odd nobody has mentioned Eclipse + CDT. After using MSVC++, Dev-C++ and Installing Code::Blocks for a trial I have found Eclipse to be the best IDE hands-down.

You install the MingW (GCC) compiler, gdb debugger and run Eclipse+CDT on any platform you choose. It's cross-platform ability alone makes it a good choice. 

Eclipse also has numerous plugins for various source control systems (CVS, SVN etc).

If you want a simple, fast IDE then Dev-C++ is the way to go. But you'd prob end up moving up to Eclipse later on if you took that path.

Conclusion:
Since we all have worked with Eclipse before in 248 and 249. Probably in 352, we could use Eclipse + CDT. It is a also cross-platform work set.
