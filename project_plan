Modules:
================================
#Map: 	
	- A map Editor (adding some developer-made maps?)
	- Critters move on path, Towers put on scenery (not on the path)
	- Cells contain maximum one element at any time (critters and towers)

#Map Editor: 	
	- Elements: path, exit and entry point
	- Elements must be placed one after the other (entry first, then one path tile at a time, until exit point)
	- Must validate the map before starting a game (or before saving it?)
	- User can save the map
	- User chooses the map’s size (max and min size)

#Game:
	- At start —> Must choose a map (user-made or developer-made?)
	- Wave-based (start when player wants)
	- Game Over if a specific amount ( =number of lives) of critters arrive at the exit point
	- *Gain back life?* When? (After 5 waves?)
		
#Tower:
	- Different Towers: Specific Style, Range, Power, Price, Rate of Fire
		Style —> IDEA: Different towers = different forms?
			       Upgrading towers = different colours? 
	- Can be upgraded (must add a Max upgrade level - 5 maybe?)
	- Can be bought at any time (during and between waves)
	- User can inspect the characteristics 
	- Area damage? Special effect (stunning, lower speed, …) ?
	- Can be sold back (== give money)
	
#Critter:
	- Arrive in succession at a finite amount
	- Move cell by cell towards the exit point
	- Each kind have a specific max HP (health points)
	- Lose HP when hit
	- If HP <= 0 —> Critter dies
	- Strength (HP and/or speed and/or number) increases every wave
	- User can inspect characteristics in play and of the wave to come 
		IDEA: Different critters: Moving letters?

#GUI:
	- A…window! (defining the size)
	- « Start the wave » button
	- TBD
	


#Money System:
	- There is an initial amount (TBD)
	- Dead critters —> gives money
	- Selling towers —> gives money (but less than when you bought it)
	- Buying towers and upgrades —> less money (of couse!)
	- End of wave —> More money??

#main

#TBD:
	- Where to shoot when critters moving???
	- Who are the towers gonna shoot? (first in range? middle? last?)
